## Why?
Many API test tools availble in market but why I look to build my own tool? after facing some issues (no installers allowed, scurity patchce blockages etc..,) in organizations I worked, I feel it is good to have my own API test tool, so I started creating own API test tool.

## What?
This is very basic standalone API testing tool, which accepts basic/no authentication, with GET & POST methods only.

## How?
This is very simple and self explanatory tool, so I dont think anybody need guidance on this tool

## System requirements?
.NET Core 3.1


## Suggesions?
Please use my tool, and kindly provide me any sort of suggestions you have.
I do have plans to upgrade this tool in future.

I'm aware that this is not a complete tool yet, but if you are in same situations which I faced definitely you will like this tool :)

### Thank you.
